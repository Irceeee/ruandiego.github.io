          <h5>Pro Support Player In Dota 2 & <span>Programmer</span></h5>
          <p>I‚Äôm Ruan Brent S. Diego, 20 years old, my birthday is on April 27, 2002. I lived in purok 3, gamu Isabela. My favorite foods are sisig, chicken, adobo, bicol express, binagoongan, beef pares, bulalo, and sinigang etc. Currently studying at Isabela State University (ISU) taking a course for Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT). I am now a 2nd-year college and we are taking a midyear class or they called it a summer class.

    	My hobbies are playing online games like Dota 2 and Valorant, I watched anime, movies, and Netflix series, and watching vlogs on youtube. I listen to music it depends on my mood. I loved to play sports like basketball, badminton, and football. I loved also to trades crypto currency. Everyone has an ambition in life. Aim or ambition is the inner aspiration of man. No man can do anything in the world without aim. So, all of us should be very determined about our aim in life. A man‚Äôs dream will never die so do whatever your dream is.  I am a very simple handsome and cute guy that has a dream and a plan for my life. My dreams are to be a successful crypto billionaire. I want to build my own restaurant or franchise a business. I want to spoil myself I will buy everything I want and to spoil my family in what they want I‚Äôll provide for their needs. And I want to build my own house someday. I exercise daily to achieve my dream body and to become fit I want to go to the gym every day but it is very far from our house so I just work out at home because it is too far. Someday I will go to Japan because this is one of my dream places that I wanna go.

    	I am an extrovert person, I have a lot of friends because I am a friendly person. And I have a weakness also everyone has a weakness, and I am no exception. I am a little lazy in several places that I dislike. I spend a lot of time playing, which is not a good habit, but I try my hardest to conquer my faults. These are all the things that express myself. I will try my best in everything I‚Äôll do and I will continue my studies until I graduate and to pursue my dreams and plan in my life.</p>

          <p>Brent is one of the most beautiful people I have known, he is so lowkey, easy and fun to be with. I also liked his honesty.
He loves to watch anime, and play video games. He‚Äôs very friendly and cheerful! ÔºàÔºæŒΩÔºæÔºâ
Just stay as you are, Brent. I‚Äôll celebrate with you your big and small wins. I wish you all the very best in life and wanted to tell, you that if you still need a friend I am always there.
Lastly, study hard. There is nothing easy in life but I assure you after all of your pain you will gain big! ‚ÄúSuccess is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice, and most of all, love of what you are doing.‚Äù
Enjoy your life, Brent. Thank you for being such a good friend. I love you (platonically) üòä

          <p>First of all, I don't know you that well. We haven't actually met, and I don't know what your real height is, etc. I only previously knew you through social media sites like Facebook. I've been observing you since you started responding to my posts, and then one day you messaged me, and that's when we started conversing. All I can say is that you are such a nice person, yet so needy. I loved the good morning and good night messages I used to get from you. Always bring your own sunshine.</p>

          <p>Ruan Diego, the friend I knew since our Junior years. The first interaction we had together is playing DOTA together with our classmates. He is an optimistic dude that really sees the good things in his view, we could say that he's kind of a Happy go lucky guy. When it comes on being approachable, this guy is my Top 1. He's a bit quirky but fun! Also, He's one of the most fortunate people I know this college time. He has high self-esteem, and his confidence is something you can't topple down. He's a great guy but he also does have downsides such as: He is quick to anger which makes him lose focus on the task and he's a bit too easy-going on some activities that result in a not-so-well outcome. But thanks to his lucky stars he got bye. Overall, Ruan Diego is awesome!</p>
